# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains medical data, including features like age, cholesterol, chest pain type, and more. Using models such as Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forests, the goal is to classify patients as having heart disease (1 = Yes) or not (0 = No).
